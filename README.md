### Introduction
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset is small, but it is widely used in the field of computer vision and machine learning.

The classes in Fashion MNIST are: <br>
T-shirt/top <br>
Trouser<br>
Pullover<br>
Dress<br>
Coat<br>
Sandal<br>
Shirt<br>
Sneaker<br>
Bag<br>
Ankle boot <br>

The dataset is a subset of a larger set available from Zalando's garment repository [1]. Each garment is described in a CSV file, including details such as type, price, and color.
